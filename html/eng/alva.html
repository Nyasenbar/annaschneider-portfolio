					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<div class="detail-intro">
						<p>Alva is a seaweed breeding facility for private use. It consists of a breeding tank, in which seaweed is cultivated, sensors and an app to monitor the water values and to help with the use of the seaweed.
						This project was made in cooperation with product design students Amelie Straubmüller, Johannes Wurster and Kim Beets. Group members from my course of studies were Jonathan Hörmann and Lukas Geiger.
						We used an Arduino to handle the sensors and a Raspberry Pi, JavaScript and Artaible, which is a cloud database, for our full stack. To visulize our sensor values in real time, we used an html site and charts.js.
						We designed the app using Adobe Xd.
					Our project was honoured by goHfG, the founding campaign of the university.</p>

					<h2>Why use Seaweed?</h2>
					<div class="subsection col2-container">
						<p class="subsection-body sf-layout">A great advantage seaweed cultivation bears is: it helps to lighten the food production. Seaweed cultivation does not rival conventional agriculture. For example, microalgae can be cultivated in tubes on house walls. Seaweed also does not require the use of soil and pesticides, while reaching up to ten times the gain of soy or corn.
						Since Seaweed contains a lot of protein, they bear the potential to drastically help in cultivating enough food for everyone, especially in light of the population growth.
						Seaweed also sequester up to 55 gramms of Carbondioxide per 30 gramms of seaweed, by performing photosynthesis.</p>

					<h2>What does Seaweed need?</h2>
					<div class="subsection col2-container">
						<p class="subsection-body sf-layout">At the beginning of the project we had to reaearch a lot about general fishkeeping and seaweed. We tried to find out which kind of algae would work best for our cause, where we would get them and what the water the algae are breeding in should be like. While researching we found a group of experts, who specialize in growing makroalgae on land. They supplied us with Ulva Lactuca, or sea lettuce, and supported us with information about it. We cultivated the seaweed in an aquarium over a few months.
						If everything is ideal, sea lettuce can grow twice as much mass within a few weeks. The most important parameters are water temperature, hardness, the amount of carbondioxide and the pH value of the water. All of the parameters can be monitored with sensors. Aside from that, the sea lettuce needs to be in motion at all times and they need lights during most of the day.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="subsection col2-container">
						<p class="subsection-body sf-layout">We decided to light up the sea lettuce using an LED strip. In order to obtain ideal results, the LED strip needed to be water-proof and it needed to have a specific kind of light colour.
						In our prototype we supplied the LED Strip with power using a power supply unit, since the LEDs need more power than an Arduino can generate.</p>

					<h2>Operating Principle</h2>
					<div id="alva-img-1" class="subsection col2-vertical dar-layout">
						<p class="subsection-body">In order to keep the maintenance of the water tank as low as possible, we used a compensation tank. Every sensor is located there and changes to the water are also easier to make in a bigger tank. Because of the cycle between the compensation and the cultivation tank, it is possible to add more cultivation tanks to the same compensation tank.</p>

					<div id="alva-img-2" class="subsection col2-vertical dar-layout">
						<p id="alva-img-2-text" class="subsection-body">The diagram shows how the sensor values are transmitted to the front end.
						The Arduino reads the sensors and sends them to a Raspberry Pi via a serial port. The Raspberry Pi transmits the values into Airtable via Wifi. The frontend html page gets the values from the databse and visualises them in graphs, creating a live feed of the sensor values</p>

				<div class="section-container">
					<h2>App</h2>
					<div class="subsection col2-container">
						<p class="subsection-body sf-layout">In order to help the user with cultivating and utilizing the sea lettuce, we created an app.
						This is the dashboard. There's a Notification section, which tells the user which tasks have to be taken care of immediatly and which are coming up. For example, in the picture the user should clean the surface of the water.
						It's also immediatly visible what the sensor values are like and if they are in the ideal area.
						Aside from that, the user is also presented with the possibility to look at recipes, in order to use the expected harvest of the week.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="subsection col2-container">
						<p class="subsection-body sf-layout">In the picture there is the history of sensor values. In order to compare the values to the growth of the algae, there's a graph for each water parameter and the growth of the sea lettuce.
						We built this screen in html, css and charts.js to be our front end in the live feed of the sensor values.
						In the following two pictures, there are a recipe and the library.</p>

					<h2>Cultivation Tank</h2>
					<div class="subsection col2-container">
						<p class="subsection-body sf-layout">Designing the cultivation tank wasn't really part of my task. I would like to mention it briefly anyways.
						All renderings were made by Amelie Straubmüller, Kim Beets and Johannes Wurster.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="subsection col2-container">
						<p class="subsection-body sf-layout">In order to harvest the sea lettuce, a basket at the bottom of the tank can be lifted by pulling on a glass tube in the middle. By doing that, the sea lettuce is lifted as well and ends up in the basket. The lid of the cultivation tank is big enough for the basket to fit inside of it. So, if the user wishes to harvest their sea lettuce without getting anything wet, they may put the basket into the lid.</p>
