					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<div class="detail-intro">
						<p>As we got more acquainted with JavaScript in the second semester, I had my first experience with programming libraries and frameworks. In the course of this I built a game using svg.js.
						The premise is, that the player moves through a maze, while collecting coins. While doing that, the player is only able to walk onto each space once. This is because there's a trail building behind the player which must not be touched, similarly to the video game classic Snake. The game is won once all coins are collected and the player has reached the exit.</p>

					<div class="col3-container">
						<div class="subsection col3-1">
							<p class="subsection-body">The line, which prevents the player from crossing their own path, is built, because the program remembers which space the player was on last. Every previously visited space is saved in an array and coloured in green. If the player touches one of these spaces anyways, they lose and receive a "Game Over" message.</p>

						<div class="subsection col3-1">
							<p class="subsection-body">The coins, which the player collects along the way, are stored in an array, once they visited the space a coin is on. As soon as the array is as long as the amount of possibly collected coins, the final block in front of the exit despawns.</p>

						<div class="subsection col3-1">
							<p class="subsection-body">In my opinion, the Event Listener is the most complex part of the game. Even before the player moves, the Event Listener has to check if the space the player intends to move onto is empty and safe.</p>
