					<h2>Sewing</h2>
					<div class="subsection col2-container">
						<p class="subsection-body sf-layout">Once I started my studies, I learnt about the concept of sewing and designing your own clothes. Ever since then I've had a great time learning to sew. Most of my knowledge is from the internet.</br>
						I sewed this pinafore dress following a YouTube tutorial by <a href="http://www.annikavictoria.com/">Annika Victoria</a>.</p>

						<p class="subsection-body sf-layout">During the first corona lockdown, I studied sewing patterns from the 1940s based on a book in my familie's posession. There are no sewing instructions for any of the patterns, so I had to try to find my own path to a wearable result.</br>
						Firstly I've made a mock up of all pieces out of thrifted bedsheets, so I could test the fit and the construction methods. I've tried some techniques for the first time like button plackets, collars and lining.</br>
						It is very interesting to see how things were cut differently in the 1940s compared to today. For example, the back panel of the skirt is longer, which ensures a leveled hem all around.</p>

					<h2>Art</h2>
					<div class="subsection col2-container">
						<p class="subsection-body sf-layout">Unlike sewing, I've been drawing for most of my life. My last art lesson might have been more than five years back, however I never stoped drawing. All drawings shown here are entirely traditional, which means they were made with pencil and paper.</br>
						I enjoy drawing and writing the most with hard pencils.</p>

					<div class="subsection col2-container">
						<p class="subsection-body sf-layout">Some years back I attempted Inktober. The goal of Inktober is to draw something with ink every day according to a prompt.</br>
						This drawing is for one of the prompts. I put this drawing aside for a long time, because I wrinkled the paper during the sketching phase. Over the course of the following 6 months, I worked on it every now and then with some thin ink pens until I've reached this result.</br>
						I'm still very proud of this drawing, despite it being about two years old.</p>

					<div class="subsection col2-container">
						<p class="subsection-body sf-layout">What I like the most about drawing is coloring. It's a very time consuming step and works best with daylight, which is way I don't do it that often.</br>
						It's always fascinating to see which vibrant colors can be achieved by layering different pencils.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<div class="detail-intro">
						<p>Although I pratice my hobbies solely in my free time rather than on a professional level, I still enjoy doing them a lot.</br>
						As you can tell, I also enjoy creating and learning something new not only in my studies but also in my free time.</p>
